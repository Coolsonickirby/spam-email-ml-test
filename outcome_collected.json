and - tumble fashion . i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex - colleagues . their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . i , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues .\nin order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $ 5 million fund . we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . i wanted you to be aware of that . i really do appreciate and understand everybody ' s upset .\nlast friday , february 22 , we presented to the creditors ' committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . as can be expected , there was some push back from the committee - - there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification .\nthe creditors ' committee formed a subcommittee . we provided to them more data . jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday , february 27 , and we met with them again on thursday , february 28 . we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors ' committee on this program .\ni have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff ' s and my highest priority . it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . i told the creditors ' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 11 to motion this up to the court . i ' ll keep you posted on progress . i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail .\nthe powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions . hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week . then , the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases . and it works its way through the review , approval and communication process . so hopefully , we ' ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases .\nwe reached an accord with the astros this week to repatriate to enron $ 2 . 1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract . it is a shame we won ' t be in a position to support the naming of the field , but it is probably in the best interest of the estate . i got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning enron field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex - employees ' fund . i ' d like your input on that . i thought it was a great idea and very generous .\nwe are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . hopefully i ' ll be able to meet many of you there . i ' ve tried to get around to say hello here and there . and again , i would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but i ' m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody ' s inquiries .\nother than that i don ' t have a lot to report . we ' ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . hopefully by next friday i ' ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . i want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward .\none other thing ?\nwe did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon . we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . we ' ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . i told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in enron ' s future . i ' ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting .\nanyway , as i was saying ?\nthanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . i hope you have a great weekend . i ' ll chat with next week .",

enron ' s\nstake in other gas - pipeline assets ; its 9 . 8 percent stake ,\nworth about $ 400 million , in eog resources ( news / quote ) , a\nformer subsidiary that is now an independent publicly\ntraded oil and gas company ; and its indirect stake in\nhanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to\nincrease the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its\nflow on interstate pipelines .\nyesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody ' s\ninvestors service , which like other major credit - rating\nfirms , currently ranks enron ' s debt at the lowest\ninvestment - grade level . if enron were to lose its\ninvestment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or\nrefinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders\nwould probably further curtail business . but by late\nyesterday , moody ' s ( news / quote ) decided not to issue a\nstatement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy\nofficials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon ,\nthe executives said . a moody ' s spokesman declined comment .\nexecutives close to the talks said that they hoped that\nnew cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and\nthe energy - trading markets that enron ' s trading floor would\nsurvive and remain a valuable asset .\nbut analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring\nhow much value the trading operation has already lost , and\nhow much the business has been reduced because of credit\nconcerns .\n\" i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in\nthe core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase\nprice as a result , \" said andre meade , head of united states\nutilities research for commerzbank securities in new york .\n\" i don ' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of\nenron over the next three to four quarters , and i ' m not\nsure enron has a good estimate . \"\nmr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy ' s earlier\nestimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to\nits earnings was \" reliable today , given how sharply the\nbusiness seems to have deteriorated . \" by mr . meade ' s\ncalculations , if enron ' s trading volumes were to fall 50\npercent next year - even if normal volume growth levels\nreturned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value\nin the stock .\nkaren denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had\nexperienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the\nnumber of traders doing business with it , but both\nstabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify\nthe decline .\nshe also said that enron ' s trading operation remained\nprofitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also\nsaid she did not know whether the company was working on a\npossible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans\nshould its business and liquidity worsen . \" we ' re moving\nforward with the merger , \" she said .\ndynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday .\nshares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible\nrevised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5\npercent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up\n4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 .\nthough yesterday ' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron\nshares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after\ndisclosures of major losses as well as significant\naccounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated\nprofits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million .\nnow , difficulties within enron ' s trading operation are\nexacerbating the company ' s overall liquidity problems in\nthree ways , according to some analysts and rival\nenergy - trading executives .\nfirst , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater\nmargin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron ' s\ntraders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas\nthan traders at other companies . this credit premium in\nsome transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for\nevery million british thermal units of gas enron buys ,\nthese people say .\nadditionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation\n( news / quote ) , have either scaled back or stopped doing\nbusiness with enron , hurting its trading revenue .\nmr . meade of commerzbank said \" end - use customers and\ntrading counterparties appear to be shifting their business\nto competitors as a result of enron ' s credit concerns and\nare reluctant to increase their exposures to enron . \"\nhow to advertise\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nfor information on advertising in e - mail newsletters\nor other creative advertising opportunities with the\nnew york times on the web , please contact alyson\nracer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media\nkit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo\nfor general information about nytimes . com , write to\nhelp @ nytimes . com .\ncopyright 2001 the new york times company",

        "msg": "while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume ,\nalliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact\nyou regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a\nstrategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of\nservices from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service ,\nreporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor\narrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been\nprovided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december\n1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of\nreorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to\nenron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing\nfee per ticket .\nto provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance\napproached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront\ndiscounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only\nthrough alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were\nstripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in\nexchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this\nmanagement fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center\nbased on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided\nenron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year\n2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of\n2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management\nfee .\nthe effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by\nthe airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline\ncompanies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the\ncontracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through\nalliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and\nalliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and\ndetermine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure .\nas mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in\nlieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees\nthrough normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee\nstructure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from\nenron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for\nenron travel is as follows :\n$ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount\n$ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount\n25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount\n$ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings\nthe savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees\nthat are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589\ndomestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings\nare $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are\nmore than three times the per ticket fee !\nif you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to\ndo so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking\ntool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through\nclicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is\nnecessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is\navailable 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site\nor via the internet site\n. clicktrip is also a useful tool for\nchecking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade\nstatus or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip\nbutton on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator\nnumber ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log -

( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated .\ncentral authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . \"\n* why hmns should be on your radar :\n1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers .\n2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry .\n3 . today ' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources .\n4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex .\n5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market .\n6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property .\n7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that \" the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company ' s product has a good chance of hitting it ! \"\n8 . the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry .\n9 . hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales , but from application service provider ( asp ) services ( from customers that \" subscribe \" to the technology and access it by the internet ) , from installation ( billable at 12 % of the total software sale ) , and recurring maintenance ( recurring annual revenue billable at 18 % of the value of the software ) .\n10 . datamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at $ 4 . 1 billion , and predicts an increase to $ 5 . 5 billion by 2007 , growing at a 6 . 0 % compounded annual growth rate .\n11 . gartner also reports positive and stable growth for software distributors , stating that end user spending was to exceed $ 76 . 1 billion by the end of 2005 .\n12 . last year alone , u . s . banks were forecasted to spend $ 1 . 9 billion on contact center technology .\n* management and other comments :\nlou mandic , hmns ceo & president : \" this technology was born out of years worth of research . we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs . we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today . we anticipate rapid growth , which is not uncommon in our industry . by its fourth year of operation , blue pumpkin - a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers - had already captured a 7 % market share . a far lesser market share will have our company earning better than $ 10 million annually . \"\ncompany philosophy :\n\" if you can measure it you can manage it . \"\n* things to consider :\naccording to empire research , the company has a competitively superior product , a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth , and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns .\nhmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers .\nhmns has buy - out appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and / or its intellectual property .\nhow the technology works\ncentral authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data . through meta data tables , the software is able to \" read \" all other technologies , and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise . the software also collects data inherently ( this is data entered directly into central authorityt , not collected from other systems ) on employees , recruiting sources and performance , enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover , which can be as high as 200 % in the contact center industry .\n* conclusion :\nthe problem with inter - departmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry . it is a problem for corporate america as a whole . companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software - one that can normalize all data , across all technologies , and act as a single , central point of contact for the enterprise .",

contracted available capacity .\n6 . market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40 % of the capacity ( after core set aside ) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process . this does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season .\nexamples of north needles capacity : physical capacity 750 mmcf / d add ' l 25 / 50 775 / 800\ncore cust . set aside 300 inc . core 313\navail . cap . for bidding 450 462 / 487\nphase i avail . cap . 225 231 / 243 . 5\nphase ii avail . cap . remainder of 225 remainder of\n231 or 243 . 5\nphase iii avail . cap . 225 + remainder 231 / 243 . 5 +\nof phases i & ii if any . remainder of\nph . i & ii if any .\nsystem adequacy proceeding - - lorenz testimony\nlad lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the socalgas system is intended to be used \" until the commission acts in the gir proceeding \" .\nin section h . of lad ' s testimony on firm receipt point access , table ii illustrates that north needles will be expanded by 50 mmcf / d to a level of 800 . in table iii under the heading of firm primary access it states \" tw - - who then allocates among its shippers \" in reference to the 800 mmcf / d of capacity listed for north needles .\nin this same section h , lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability \" until the commission acts to approve the csa \" .\ncpuc decision 01 - 12 - 018 on socalgas unbundling\nthe commission approved the csa on dec . 11 , 2001 with certain modifications . these modifications included :\n1 . market concentration limits were decreased from 40 % to 30 % and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts . secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit .\n2 . a secondary market price cap was established at 120 % of the interruptible rate ( $ . 07191 ) .\n3 . reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044 mmcf / d ( csa lowered it to 1000 ) . this explains why the core reservation for needles is 313 and doesn ' t match the tw / socal contract level . the additional 44 was allocated per a calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with needles receiving an additional 13 mmcf / d .\nin the summary and conclusion sections of the decision , socalgas was directed to include the additional 375 mmcf / d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season . this part of the order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines . additionally socalgas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions .",

steve cooper\nfebruary 14 , 2002\nhi everybody , this is steve cooper . it is february 14 , so happy valentine ' s day to everybody . i just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on .\nfirst of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally - - i ' ve just been busy and jammed up this week , but i do want you to know i really appreciate it . it ' s been a little hectic this week , so i do apologize for the delay in getting back to you .\nanyway , a couple of things have happened this week and i just want to make sure everybody understands what they are . number one is the result of the special investigative report . we ' re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result rick buy and rick causey ' s employment with the company has been terminated . to the extent that there are any additional changes , obviously i ' ll keep you up to speed .\nwe ' re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the board . six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days . we ' re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors , which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted .\nat the board meeting this week , i reiterated that it ' s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor ' s committee by the second quarter , and nothing that i see today leads me conclude that we can ' t make that schedule . i continue to believe that there is a very nice re - organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward .\nthere was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day .\nthe media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen .\na couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are .\nwe are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates .\nand another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things .\nthat ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day .\nif you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .",

and\n- - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings .\nwe ' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review .\ncore businesses\nour core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they ' re our competitive advantage . these include :\n- - natural gas pipeline businesses ;\n- - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ;\n- - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and\n- - coal businesses in north america and europe .\nthe events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it ' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 .\ni also remain optimistic that the actions we ' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships .\nnon - core businesses\nour non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal .\nwe have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals .\nbusinesses under review\nthese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation .\nreviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available .\ncredit rating / 10 - q filing\nwe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows :\n- - moody ' s at baa 3 \" under review for further downgrade \"\n- - fitch at bbb - \" evolving status \"\n- - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 .\nin addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered \" participants in the solicitation \" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .",

' ' ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , ' ' mr . palmer said . even if dynegy ' s directors later voted to award mr . lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr . palmer added .\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : armstrong , julie\nsent : wednesday , november 14 , 2001 9 : 22 am\nto : lohman , tk\nsubject :\nsee about traders\n11 / 14 / 2001\nthe wall street journal\na 3\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\nenron corp . said its chairman , kenneth lay , has decided to forgo a severance payment of $ 60 . 6 million that could be triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay ' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice .\nearly in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay ' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities .\nbut by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn ' t attend the traders ' meeting , senior managers told him that \" opinions were expressed that he shouldn ' t receive the payment , \" mr . palmer said . \" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . \" the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron ' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day .\nthe initial disclosure about mr . lay ' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . \" things weren ' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , \" mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won ' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director .\nfor the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation .\nenron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company ' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies .\nseparately , the california public employees ' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron ' s board \" failed in its responsibility \" to monitor the activities of enron executives .\nmr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling ' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 .\nunder the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million .\nmr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn ' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron ' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay ' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay .\nmr . palmer said it is a \" cheap shot \" to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . \" the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , \" mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing \" the very best service possible . \" mark lay couldn ' t be reached for comment .\ncoming on top of disclosures of enron ' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron ' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships .\nmark lay ' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and \" certain other individuals \" who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron ' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up \" a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , \" according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron ' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business .\nas part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to \" convey \" to enron \" certain intangible property rights \" from ppmc .\nmark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer .\nsince 1985 , sharon lay ' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm ' s revenue in some years . she said her brother ' s position was \" more a problem \" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn ' t worked hard enough to get enron ' s business .",

cut\nnorth - flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata\nto meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling\nthrough kemmerer ; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries\nfrom receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate\nconfirmed nominations ; entitle for undertakes or overtakes , as appropriate ;\nand finally , if required , northwest will issue operational flow orders .\nif net scheduled volumes north through northwest ' s kemmerer compressor do\nnot exceed physical capacity , northwest will have much greater flexibility\nduring the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins . northwest ' s customers can\nhelp themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by\nsecuring adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson\nprairie storage during this work .\nnorthwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of\nthe clay basin and transwestern shut - ins and will be monitoring the\nsituation closely . northwest will take every opportunity to relax system\nrestrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate . northwest is\nconfident that if its customers respond prudently , the impact of the\ntranswestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced .\nif you have any questions , please contact your marketing services\nrepresentative .",

it ' s the morning of january 29 th and i wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased i am to have been selected as enron ' s interim ceo . my firm , zolfo cooper , my partners and i have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process . i just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward .\ni can ' t imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you . i ' m sure it ' s been incredibly difficult , particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched . in that environment , i ' ve got to believe it ' s difficult , if not impossible , for you to focus on what lies ahead for enron and for the organization .\ni ' m not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning , however , i ' d like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this .\nit ' s been the experience of myself , my firm , my partners , that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy , we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings . those metrics are typically the organization , the asset base that the company has to bring to bear , customer base , and liquidity . from what i ' ve been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here , enron has a very , very bright , very capable , very committed , hardworking and dedicated organization . all of the people i have met are committed to reorganize , restructure and bring enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy .\nnumber 2 , the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here . the regulated assets , the pipelines , the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around .\nthird , loyal customers . most of enron ' s customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis .\nand fourth , liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand , the cash it expects to generate in the near term , and with the backstop of the dip financing , it doesn ' t appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward .\nwith those four resources nicely in place , i ' m very confident that we can successfully restructure this company . i don ' t want to leave the impression that it will be easy . it ' s going to be an enormous amount of work . there will be upsets , issues , and concerns along the way . but i can tell you that i ' ve seen companies in bankruptcy that don ' t have nearly as strong a position as this company . they were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy , and i ' m certain enron will also .\ni ' m looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and i ' m very pleased to be here . jeff , ray and i will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward . if there are any thoughts , concerns , issues that you would like to bring to my attention , please don ' t hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call .\nthanks so much , and i look forward to working with all of you .",
